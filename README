The Dane County Clerk's office publishes election results online here:

However, the reports look more like they're from an ImageWriter II somehow
connected to the web. Consider this:

Which isn't the easiest thing to extract through XPath. 

This python script tries to extract a JSON document from the results.

Usage is simple:

	python extract-dane-election-data.py http://www.countyofdane.com/clerk/elect2011s2.html 

It requires lxml and a json library.

Hopefully your county clerk reports results in something more structured than ours, and
hopefully our County Clerk's office updates its reporting software to be something more
machine-friendly in the future.

TODO:

If there's a standard markup for election results, I'd love to report out in that instead
of with a JSON dump of an python data structure.
